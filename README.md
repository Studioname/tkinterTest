Miles to km converter in tkinter

Main contains the unguided exercise, the other files are tutorial related. I say unguided, because there was no input from the instructor when it came to making
the app, we had to do it with what we had learned in the tutorial. And it went rather smoothly! I was happy to finally be working with GUI's. Turtle was fun but
very simple, and quite restrictive in places. Tkinter on the other hand seems like a big step up. Making things happen on screen is one of my favourite things
to do, and i take it as a real show of progress that i am getting somewhere.
